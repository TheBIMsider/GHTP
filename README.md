# GHTP - Carl's Golf Shame Repository 🤦‍♂️

**⚠️ Personal Data Alert**: This is my actual golf tracking app with real (embarrassingly high) scores. 

My personal version of the public GHT app - trust me nobody wants these golf stats ⛳🤔

**Public GHT version with instructions and a repo to fork avalibale [HERE](https://github.com/TheBIMsider/GHT)**

# 🏌️‍♂️ Golf Handicap Tracker

A simple, web-based golf handicap calculator that helps golfers track their rounds and calculate their USGA Handicap Index. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages with data storage via Google Sheets.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Development

This project was created as a "vibe coding" session using **Claude Sonnet 4** AI assistance, with human guidance and golf expertise provided by **Carl Storms** aka ["The BIMsider"](https://bio.link/thebimsider). 

*A collaboration between human creativity and AI efficiency - proving that even bad golfers can build good apps.*
