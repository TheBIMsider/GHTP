# GHTP
My personal version of the public GHT app - trust me nobody wants this golf stats ⛳🤔

You can find the public version with instrcutions and a repo to fork [HERE](https://github.com/TheBIMsider/GHT)

# 🏌️‍♂️ Golf Handicap Tracker

A simple, web-based golf handicap calculator that helps golfers track their rounds and calculate their USGA Handicap Index. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages with data storage via Google Sheets.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Development

This project was created as a "vibe coding" session using **Claude Sonnet 4** AI assistance, with human guidance and golf expertise provided by **Carl Storms** aka ["The BIMsider"](https://bio.link/thebimsider). Carl's unfortunately high golf scores serve as realistic test data throughout the examples! 🏌️‍♂️⛳

*A collaboration between human creativity and AI efficiency - proving that even bad golfers can build good apps.*
